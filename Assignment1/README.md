The notebook "Multiclass Classification using NN with SGD" is my implementation of a 3-layer neural network from scratch for a 3-class classification problem. Here are the specifics:
1. Number of hidden layers = 2
2. Number of nodes in each layer:
    - input layer: 2
    - first hidden layer: 5
    - second hidden layer: 5
    - output layer: 3
3. Activation functions:
    - hidden layers: tanh
    - output layer: softmax
4. Number of epochs: 1000
5. Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent
6. Learning rate: 0.001
